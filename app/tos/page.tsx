		<div className="leading-relaxed">
			1. Introduction
			<br />
			By using Ship.Fast you confirm your acceptance of, and agree to be bound
			by, these terms and conditions.
			<br />
			<br />
			2. Agreement to Terms and Conditions
			<br />
			This Agreement takes effect on the date on which you first use the Ship.Fast
			application.
			<br />
			<br />
			3. Term and Termination.
			<br />
			Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective
            Date and shall continue for one (1) month (the “Initial Subscription Term”) and 
            such term will automatically renew for successive monthly periods from the
            Effective Date (a “Renewal Subscription Term”) unless you cancel before 
            the expiration of the then-current term. You may downgrade Your 
            Subscription Plan to a free plan as set forth in the Product. 
            “Subscription Term” shall mean the Initial Subscription Term and subsequent
            Renewal Subscription Term(s). We also reserve the right to change any of
            the terms of this Agreement for any and all Renewal Subscription Terms. 
            You may also terminate this Agreement at any time by ceasing use of the 
            Product. This Agreement will terminate immediately upon written notice from
            Ship.Fast if You fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Except
            for Section 2 (“License Grant”), all Sections of this Agreement shall 
            survive termination. On termination of this Agreement, You and each of
            Your employee users must cease using the Solution and Ship.Fast may destroy
            all of Your prompts, queries and/or data that You have submitted to the Solution. 
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, You may continue to use Your Generated Code on termination 
            in accordance with the terms of this Agreement which shall survive 
            as to Your use of such Generated Code.

			Termination.  Credits included in a Subscription Plan that are not used within Your then-current Subscription
            Term will not roll over for use in the subsequent Renewal Subscription Term.
            “On-demand” Credits purchased outside of a Subscription Plan must be used within thirty (30) days of purchase 
            and will expire on the thirty (30th) day. All Credits are “use it or lose it.”
